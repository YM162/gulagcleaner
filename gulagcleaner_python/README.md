Gulag Cleaner is a tool designed to remove advertisements from PDFs, making it easier to read and navigate documents without being disrupted by unwanted ads.

This tool does not just crop the ads out of the PDF, instead, we extract the original file without ads by manipulating the internal structure of the PDF, ensuring maximum quality.

In addition to removing advertisements, Gulag Cleaner is also capable of extracting metadata, such as the author, subject, university, and more, from the file.

# Web Version

This tool can be used without installation directly from [our website](https://gulagcleaner.com) (in Spanish).

We're always looking for ways to improve Gulag Cleaner, and we welcome contributions from the community. If you have ideas for improvements or bug fixes, please feel free to submit a pull request.

## TODO
If you want to help, these are the top priorities right now:

* Write tests for the package.
* Add README.md (With code examples) for the rust and JS distributions.
* Add comments to a lot of the rust code.
* Optimize the rust code for performance improvements.
* Add a new "clean_pdf_bytes()" function in python that does not require a file path, just the bytes.
